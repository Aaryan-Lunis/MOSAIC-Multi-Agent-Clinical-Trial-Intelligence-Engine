#Centralized logging
# If not used, logs of different modules by different devs will be inconsistent
#logging_config makes it uniform

#It makes every log look like this:
#Timestamp | Log-level info | Origin file name | message

import logging #log levels: DEBUG/INFO/WARNING/CRITICAL/ERROR
import sys #we are going to write all the logs to stdout

#so cloud run captures them automatically
# cloud run reads stdout and sends it to google cloud logging
